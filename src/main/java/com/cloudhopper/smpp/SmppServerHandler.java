/**
 * Handles events received on an SmppServer.  Handles events for processing

 * the sessions.  The life cycle of a session is as follows:
 *
 *   1) New socket/channel connected
 *   2) Assigned a sessionId and calls sessionBindRequested
 *   3) If sessionBindRequested is ok, creates a new session, and calls sessionCreated
 *   4) When socket/channel is closed, calls sessionDestroyed
